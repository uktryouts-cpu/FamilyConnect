# FamilyConnect | The Global Heritage Ledger

FamilyConnect is a production-grade ancestry mapping platform designed for the modern era. It combines zero-knowledge encryption with autonomous AI agents (The Sentinel) to help families rediscover lost connections without compromising their privacy.

## Core Pillars
- **Privacy-First**: Your data is encrypted locally using a Master Key we never see.
- **Autonomous Discovery**: The Sentinel agent scans global records and public footprints to find potential matches.
- **Cinematic Experience**: A human-centric design approach using the "Luminous Horizon" aesthetic for a hopeful, engaging journey.
- **Multimodal AI**: Integrated Gemini 3.0 Pro for deep reasoning, Veo 3.1 for memory animation, and Gemini TTS for narration.

## Getting Started
1. **Initialize Your Ledger**: Enter your details and define your research context.
2. **Secure Your Vault**: Create a strong Master Key.
3. **Engage the Sentinel**: Let the AI agent start scouting for your heritage.
4. **Build the Map**: Connect nodes and upload memories to the interactive tree.
