# FamilyConnect User Guide

Welcome to your family's new digital home. This guide explains how to navigate your heritage journey.

## Navigating the Interface
- **Overview (Dashboard)**: Your command center. View the "Family Story" synthesized by AI and see current Sentinel progress.
- **Map (Family Tree)**: An interactive view of your lineage. Click nodes to focus on specific members.
- **Sentinel (AI Agent)**: View the "Thought Stream" of your AI assistant as it researches your family.
- **Archives (Memory Studio)**: Create portraits of ancestors you don't have photos for, or animate old family pictures.

## Common Tasks
### Adding a Member
Click "Expand Ledger" on the Dashboard. Provide as much detail as possible (Towns and Birth Years are critical for the AI).

### Using the Sentinel
The Sentinel starts working automatically. If it finds a match, a notification will appear. You can then visit the **Leads** tab to review and "Connect to Tree."

### Security Tip
Your **Master Key** is the only way to unlock your family data. We do not store it, so if you lose it, your data remains safely encrypted but inaccessible.
