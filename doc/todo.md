# FamilyConnect Development Ledger (Todo)

## Phase 1: Archival Integrity (Completed)
- [x] **Autonomous Sentinel**: Integrated Gemini 3.0 Pro for tree auditing and report synthesis.
- [x] **Discovery Flow**: Automatic audit triggering upon node addition.
- [x] **Cinematic Background**: Luminous Horizon v4 implementation.
- [x] **Z-K Vault**: Local AES-256 encryption.
- [x] **Evidence Vault**: Added citation management and source analysis.
- [x] **Ancestor Personas**: Implemented first-person AI simulation based on node metadata.
- [x] **Heatmap Viz**: Added Geographic Distribution view.

## Phase 2: Advanced Intelligence (v4.3 - In Progress)
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution Agent**: Specific reasoning task to reconcile differing archival records for the same individual.
- [ ] **Multi-Speaker Oral History**: Enhanced multi-voice Live API sessions for capturing interviews with elders.
- [ ] **DNA Signal Analysis**: Local analysis of raw DNA files for node intersection detection.

## Priority: Scaling & Security (Moonshots)
- [ ] **IndexedDB Migration**: Move storage from LocalStorage (5MB limit) to IndexedDB for large trees and media blobs.
- [ ] **Collaborative Encryption**: Z-K key sharing protocol for family "Circles" (Multi-user decryption).
- [ ] **Blind Vault Sync**: Encrypted server-side backup without server access to the Master Key.
- [ ] **Blockchain Verification**: Anchoring discovery reports on-chain for tamper-proof heritage proof.

## Refinement
- [ ] **D3.js Optimization**: Virtualized rendering for trees exceeding 1,000 nodes.
- [ ] **Global Search Expansion**: Direct API hooks to major public parish and census databases.
- [ ] **Multilingual Nuance**: AI-assisted translation for historical documents found by the Sentinel.
