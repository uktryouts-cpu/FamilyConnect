# The Sentinel: Autonomous Intelligence Node

The Sentinel is a sophisticated agentic system designed for pro-active heritage discovery and lineage auditing.

## Intelligence Protocols

### 1. System Audit (Reasoning Layer)
Whenever the lineage ledger is updated, the Sentinel initiates an end-to-end audit.
- **Model**: Gemini 3.0 Pro.
- **Logic**: It cross-references current nodes to identify logical inconsistencies and high-value research opportunities.
- **Enhanced Criteria**: Audits ancestral occupations, life milestones, and shared professional lineages.

### 2. Archival Discovery (Grounding Layer)
The agent utilizes `googleSearch` to verify its hypotheses against real-world data.
- **Tools**: Google Search, Google Maps.
- **Grounding**: Extracts verified URLs and snippets to build a high-fidelity "Lead Feed".

### 3. Evidence Verification (Citation Layer)
Analyzes user-provided archival links to ensure they align with the node context.
- **Process**: Extracts metadata from URLs and checks for temporal/spatial overlap.
- **Status**: Assigns 'Verified' or 'Disputed' badges to evidence links.

### 4. Persona Simulation (Empathy Layer)
Synthesizes a first-person personality for tree nodes.
- **Context**: Merges occupations, era-specific language patterns, and biographical notes.
- **Interaction**: Allows users to "speak" with their ancestors to reveal hidden narrative context.

## Future Evolution
- **Logic Puzzles**: The ability for the Sentinel to ask the user clarifying questions to resolve tree conflicts.
- **Collaborative Scouting**: Shared agents that scout for links between two different user trees.
