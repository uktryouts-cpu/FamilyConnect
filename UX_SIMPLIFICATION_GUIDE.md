## How to Use the App - Simple Steps

### Step 1: Add Family Members
1. Click **"Add Family Member"** button
2. Enter their name, location, and any other details you know
3. Repeat until you've added several family members

💡 **Tip:** The more family members you add, the better matches we can find for you.

### Step 2: View Potential Matches
1. Go to the **"Leads"** section (or tap the link on the Dashboard)
2. You'll see a list of people who might be your relatives
3. Each person shows:
   - **Photo** - A thumbnail of their picture
   - **Name & Location** - Where they might be from
   - **Match Score** - How confident we are (0-100%)
   - **Why They Match** - The reason we think you're related

### Step 3: Connect with Matches
For each potential match, you have two buttons:
- **"Add to Tree"** - Add them directly to your family tree
- **"Contact"** - Send them a message asking to connect

### Step 4: Send a Connection Message
When you click "Contact":
1. Choose a message template or write your own
2. Pick from three friendly templates:
   - "Heritage Discovery" - Tell them you found genealogical connections
   - "Family Research" - Explain you're researching family history
   - "Reconnection" - Express interest in reconnecting
3. Customize the message if you like
